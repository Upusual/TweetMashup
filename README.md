# TweetMashup
Attempt to create an application that does what tweetmashup.com used to do.
I showed up to the party too late to enjoy tweetmashup.com, but I figure, "hey, I'm learning Python, and the course I last took discussed getting data off of Twitter with Python, so why not make it a project to make an application that does what the site used to do?"
So here I am.
