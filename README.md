# TweetMashup
An attempt to create an application that does what tweetmashup.com used to do.
I showed up to the party too late to enjoy tweetmashup.com, but I figure, "hey, I'm learning Python, and the course I last took discussed getting data off of Twitter with Python, so why not make it a project to make an application that does what the site used to do?"

So here I am.

I figure, if anything, it's a hilarious choice for a first difficult project, and a local instance might offer some advantages over a website (not going down being one of them).

Anyway, I don't expect it to be fast or easy to achieve the same level of sophistication in program execution as a data science author, but I hope to at least get started with something workable, if crude, in the next month or so.
